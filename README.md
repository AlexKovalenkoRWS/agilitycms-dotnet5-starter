## Getting Started

To start using the Agility CMS & .NET 5 Starter, [sign up](https://agilitycms.com/free) for a FREE account and create a new Instance using the Blog Template.

ðŸš¨  Before you dive into the code, it's important that you have the latest version of the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine (>=v5.0), as the project will *not* run without this.

### Generating/Syncing Content Models from your Agility Instance

1. cd into the `Agility.NET5.AgilityCLI` directory.
2. Rename the `App.config.example` file to `App.config`.
3. Overwrite the values in the `App.config` file with the values from the API Keys page in [Agility Settings](https://manager.agilitycms.com/settings/apikeys).
4. Run `dotnet run update preview` to download the Content Models from your Agility CMS instance, and generate the classes of the Content Models for you.

### Setting up the Starter

1. cd into the `Agility.NET5.Starter` directory.
2. Rename the `appsetting.json.example` file to `appsettings.json`.
